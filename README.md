Silverorange
========================

Save posts to the database:

The url to post to is - https://silverorange.herokuapp.com/import
- It must be a POST, GET will not be accepted.
- I have been using https://apitester.com/ for testing.
- Note that one or many post files can be accepted at once (takes array of objects or a single object) 

Get single post by id:
https://silverorange.herokuapp.com/post/{uuid}

Get all posts in reverse chronological order of created at data:
https://silverorange.herokuapp.com/post
- If you inspect the html on this page above each title there will be a comment with the created date

Delete all rows in the post table:
https://silverorange.herokuapp.com/delete

A few more things I skipped because of time constraint:
- Writing tests
- Most Error handling (example posts having valid author ids)
- Most Constraint checking
- Styling Front End
- Configuration based off environment (dev, stage, etc), this was assumed to be production for the most part
- There are some comments, but not everything is commented

I would normally use ORM for database handling with Symfony, however I realize the need to see lower 
level database coding for this test so it was implemented without instead.

I did not remove any of the default skeleton that comes with symfony in, for example "DefaultController"
